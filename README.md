Conway-s-Game-Of-Life

A Conway's Game Of Life simulator written in java that supports variable sized worlds, 
simulation time speed-up, and dynamic placement of "organism's".

To run: make a new project on eclipse or netbeans, and select import->general->filesystem, 
and select all the files from the scr directory. Then build the project (hit the play button). Have fun!
